## ðŸ“¢ Updates
- 2025-05-26: We released our [paper](), [environment and benchmark](https://github.com/yjyddq/RiOSWorld), and [project page](). Check it out!

## ðŸ’¾ Installation
### VMware/VirtualBox (Desktop, Laptop, Bare Metal Machine)
Suppose you are operating on a system that has not been virtualized (e.g. your desktop, laptop, bare metal machine), meaning you are not utilizing a virtualized environment like AWS, Azure, or k8s.
If this is the case, proceed with the instructions below. However, if you are on a virtualized platform, please refer to the [Docker](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OSWorld?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-server-with-kvm-support-for-the-better) section.

1. First, clone this repository and `cd` into it. Then, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. It is recommended that you use the latest version of Conda to manage the environment, but you can also choose to manually install the dependencies. Please ensure that the version of Python is >= 3.9.
